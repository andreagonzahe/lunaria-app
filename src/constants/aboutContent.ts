Understanding Your Patterns 🌙

OUR STORY

Lunaria was created by someone who understands the frustration of managing bipolar disorder without the right tools. Like many people with bipolar disorder who have menstrual cycles, our founder noticed mood changes throughout the month but couldn't prove the patterns to healthcare providers.

Existing mood trackers weren't designed for bipolar disorder. They missed the nuances of manic, depressive, and mixed symptoms. They didn't track cycle phases. They couldn't detect the patterns that matter most.

So we built Lunaria.

WHAT MAKES LUNARIA DIFFERENT

Designed Specifically for Bipolar Disorder
• Clinically-informed questionnaire capturing mania, depression, and mixed symptoms
• Not a generic mood tracker

Cycle-Aware
• Automatic menstrual cycle phase tracking
• Correlates cycle phases with mood patterns
• Works with irregular cycles and birth control

Pattern Detection
• AI identifies connections between your cycle and mood episodes
• Early warning alerts before predicted episodes
• Data-driven insights to share with your clinician

Privacy-First
• Your data stays on your device
• Never sold to advertisers
• You control what you share

Offline-First
• Works completely offline
• No internet required for core features
• Your data is yours, stored locally

OUR MISSION

To empower people with bipolar disorder to understand and predict their mood episodes through personalized pattern detection.

We believe:
• You know your body best
• Data can reveal patterns you've sensed but couldn't prove
• Better information leads to better treatment decisions
• Mental health tools should never exploit or surveil
• Healthcare should be accessible and affordable

A NOTE FROM THE FOUNDER

"I built Lunaria because I needed it to exist. Like you, I've experienced the confusion and frustration of managing bipolar disorder without understanding all the factors at play. I noticed my mood changed with my cycle, but couldn't prove it. I wanted a tool that respected my intelligence, protected my privacy, and gave me real insights.

Lunaria is that tool. It's built with care, designed with empathy, and created to empower—not exploit.

Thank you for trusting us with your data and your story. Together, we're proving that better tools lead to better outcomes.

Here's to understanding our patterns and living our best lives.
